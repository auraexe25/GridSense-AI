# Strict Development Protocol

- **File Management:** DO NOT create additional markdown files, READMEs, or documentation files (.md) without explicit confirmation for each file.
- **Visual Constraints:** NO EMOJIS. Emojis are strictly prohibited in code, comments, logs, and strings.
- **Commenting:** Keep comments ultra-concise. Avoid comments entirely if the code is self-explanatory. Never be overly explanatory.
- **Architecture:** Strictly adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- **Refactoring:** If logic is repeated, abstract it into a reusable component.
- **Output:** Provide complete code blocks. Avoid "// ... rest of code" placeholders.
- **Logic:** Follow YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)—do not add speculative features or over-engineer abstractions.
